This assignment focuses on implementing clustering algorithms to analyze and group data points based on shared characteristics, leveraging fundamental concepts in unsupervised learning. Students explore algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering, applying them to diverse datasets to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.

The project involves preprocessing data, selecting appropriate distance metrics, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating clustering performance using methods like the silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index. Through this hands-on approach, students learn to manage challenges such as scaling data, handling noise, and choosing optimal cluster numbers.

The final deliverable includes visualizations and interpretations of the clusters, highlighting their practical implications and providing insights into the datasetâ€™s structure. This assignment emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application of clustering techniques in Python.
