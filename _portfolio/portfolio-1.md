This assignment centers on implementing and analyzing regularized regression models using the GLMnet framework, focusing on linear and logistic regression. Students explore the use of regularization techniques like Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) to handle multicollinearity and feature selection in high-dimensional datasets.

Key tasks include understanding and applying the coordinate descent algorithm, fine-tuning hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter \(\lambda\), and interpreting the resulting sparse models. The project emphasizes hands-on experience with Python, requiring students to preprocess data, evaluate model performance using cross-validation, and visualize the effect of regularization on coefficients.

Through this structured approach, students gain a comprehensive understanding of regularized regression, its mathematical underpinnings, and its practical applications in predictive modeling and feature selection.
