This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing relationships between different image categories in the CIFAR-10 dataset using advanced dimensionality reduction techniques. The work combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) to explore similarities between image classes and create meaningful low-dimensional representations of the data.

Students implement various mathematical methods, including efficient SVD computations, distance calculations between image classes, and handling non-metric similarities using the Lingoes correction. The project requires implementing these techniques from scratch in Python, optimizing for computational efficiency, and creating visualizations to represent the relationships between different image categories.

Through multiple structured tasks, students gain hands-on experience with fundamental concepts in machine learning and computer vision while learning to handle practical challenges in processing and analyzing large image datasets. The ultimate goal is to develop a deep understanding of how different image categories relate to each other and how to effectively represent high-dimensional image data in lower dimensions for analysis and visualization purposes.
