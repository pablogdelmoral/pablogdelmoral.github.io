I am currently pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Data Science at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). My passion lies in exploring artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their intersections with mathematics. I focus on understanding and applying concepts like neural networks, large language models (LLMs), and support vector machines, with a growing interest in their applications in finance and optimization.

My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics and numerical methods, which I continuously build on to deepen my understanding of machine learning algorithms. Additionally, I am developing technical skills in tools like Docker, GitHub, and shell scripting to enhance my ability to train and deploy AI models effectively.

I am excited to keep learning and contributing to projects where I can apply my knowledge, collaborate with others, and grow as a professional in the fields of AI and data science.

## Hobbies and Interests

My main hobby is playing the violin, a passion I’ve pursued for years. I hold an ABRSM Level 4 certification, which reflects my dedication to honing my skills and enjoying the beauty of music as a creative outlet.

I spent a summer at the SKKU Summer International Semester, where I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence. This experience allowed me to explore key concepts, engage in hands-on projects, and collaborate with an international community of learners, further fueling my passion for AI and its applications.
